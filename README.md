# Rules extraction from Healthcare policy
*Tools for protecting vital healthcare programs by extracting actionable knowledge from policy.*

### Benefit Rules
We provide a [collection of 'benefit rules'](benefit_rules.json) that are both human-understandable and machine consumable, extracted from policy. These BRs are intended to be used to flag discrepancies in insurance claims with limited human effort.

### PAS Tuple extraction
[Jupyter notebooks](spacy-extractor) showcasing the PAS tuple extraction implementation with the learned rules.

### Ontology and Entity Lifting
We provide a [base ontology](ontology-and-lifting) and instructions on how to add domain-specific entities to it.
