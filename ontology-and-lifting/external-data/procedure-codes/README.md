#Procedure Codes

The claims audit system uses CPT and HCPCS codes. These are collections of standardized codes that represent medical procedures, supplies, products and services. The codes are used to facilitate the processing of health insurance claims by Medicare and other insurers.

A useful general explanation of these codes can be found in the article [What is HCPCS?](https://www.aapc.com/resources/medical-coding/hcpcs.aspx)  They summarise the difference between the code sets as follows:
 - CPTÂ® codes: what the provider did.
 - HCPCS codes: what the provider used.
 - ICD-10-CM: why the provider 'did' and 'used'.

As these are proprietary codes we cannot directly supply a copy.
Please see [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/MedHCPCSGenInfo/index.html) for information about the codes and how to access them
